EVTZKTVstmw,a beautiful mind schizophrenia explained can be treated #shorts #johnnash #schizophrenia,in this video a beautiful mind schizophrenia explained we will be briefly touching on schizophrenia a severe mental health condition that affects approximately 1 of the population one well known example of schizophrenia is the life of john nash a nobel prize winning mathematician whose story was depicted in the movie a beautiful mind the symptoms of schizophrenia can vary from person to person but typically fall into three categories positive symptoms negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms positive symptoms refer to experiences that are added to a person s behavior or thoughts while negative symptoms refer to experiences that are removed from a person s behavior or thoughts cognitive symptoms refer to difficulties with memory attention and decision making one example of positive symptoms is hallucinations which can involve seeing hearing or feeling things that are not there in a beautiful mind john nash experiences auditory hallucinations in the form of imaginary people who he believed were his colleagues and friends these hallucinations can be extremely distressing and can make it difficult to distinguish between reality and fiction another example of positive symptoms is delusions such as those john nash had in a beautiful mind which are false beliefs that are not based in reality in the movie john nash becomes convinced that he is a secret agent working for the government and that his hallucinations are part of his job these delusions can be dangerous if they lead to behaviors that are harmful to oneself or others negative symptoms can include a lack of motivation difficulty expressing emotions and a loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyable in a beautiful mind john nash experiences a lack of motivation to continue his work as a mathematician despite his natural talent and passion for the subject this lack of motivation can make it difficult to function in daily life and can impact relationships and work cognitive symptoms can include difficulty with memory attention and decision making in the movie john nash struggles with social interactions and has difficulty understanding social cues and norms these cognitive symptoms can make it difficult to perform daily tasks and can impact overall quality of life it s important to note that there are additional symptoms of schizophrenia beyond those depicted in the movie for example some people with schizophrenia may experience disordered speech such as rambling or using nonsensical language they may also exhibit abnormal movements such as repetitive motions or unusual postures while there is no cure for schizophrenia it can be treated with a combination of medication therapy and support antipsychotic medication can help alleviate positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions while therapy can help individuals develop coping skills and improve social interactions support from family and friends can also play a crucial role in managing the symptoms of schizophrenia in conclusion schizophrenia is a complex and often debilitating mental health condition that can impact all aspects of a person s life while the symptoms can vary from person to person they typically fall into three categories positive symptoms negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms it s important to recognize that there are additional symptoms beyond those depicted in popular media and that schizophrenia can be treated with a combination of medication therapy and support by reducing symptoms and improving quality of life individuals with schizophrenia can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives #microdosetherapy #schizophrenia #abeautifulmind #johnnash music from #uppbeat free for creators uppbeat io t tobias voigt machina,john nash in a beautiful mind experienced hallucinations and delusions but schizophrenia has other symptoms as well such as disorganized speech abnormal movements or a lack of motivation with its symptoms ranging from mild to severe schizophrenia is a complex disorder myths and stigmas surrounding schizophrenia prevent people from seeking help although there are effective treatments we can create an inclusive society for those with schizophrenia by increasing awareness so what myths have you heard this is microdose therapy your daily dose of psych,256,0,reliable,2,youtube,5.54907608489522,0.0,1.0986122886681098,11,577,84,0.0,0.0078125

prescriptions for my newfound friend i knew my younger brother had recently stopped taking his prescription due to the appetite loss side effect when i went home for break after finals i located the bottle beneath my parents bathroom sink and dumped out a hundred or so into my palm scurrying back to my bedroom i immediately smashed out a few lines and was flying high for the afternoon nevermind that i had to care for my brother adderall had taken hold within two weeks of returning to school i was carrying a pre crushed jar of powder in my backpack with one end of a tampon applicator to snort it it took less than that amount of time to run through what i had stolen from my brother fueled by a diet of prescription amphetamines coffee alcohol weed and cigarettes i began to pilfer from my friends prescriptions they would give me some and i always took a few extra for the road justifying it with the reasoning that they would have more next month they only needed it to study i needed it to survive or so i thought the comedown my run with adderall was a sporadic and passionate love affair there were times my ability to find it would dry up and i would slave through the weeks of frustration agitation and cravings then i would find another friend with a prescription and repeat the process all over again it all culminated when the adderall alcohol marijuana and other drugs landed me at the end of my senior year with three uncompleted classes three weeks before graduation i knew there was nothing normal about the amount of substances i used i couldn t do anything without smoking a bowl snorting a line or swallowing a shot a caring professor sat me down after class one day and mentioned the papers i had produced throughout the year she brought up the allusions to substance abuse peppered throughout my work the run on sentences and rambling thoughts fueled by legal amphetamines she explained to me that she had just celebrated 10 years of sobriety in march using a program with a path to sobriety she told me her story of swigging from bottles beneath her desk before classes started it was as though she was looking into my mind reading the thoughts as they raced through my brain she knew me and she didn t even know me she put me in touch with another student in the program who took me to my first meeting i was astounded at the things these people shared amazed that i felt the same way they did still wary of giving up my drugs i went to a few meetings high after a couple of weeks though something stuck and i found myself sober for days at a time,so

lxC7FMwKgxQ,mental health suicide prevention author jeff davis #shorts #mentalhealth #suicideprevention,fourteen years ago when i was seventeen years old i hit rock bottom sadly i became suicidal in this incredibly difficult time just before i was about to give up hope for good i went into deep meditation in this meditation the deepest of my life i went into a field of pure energy i realized that everything is energy although this happened a long time ago i still think about this enlightening moment a lot the reason for that is because i see so much dysfunction and strife in our world today it s a crazy place and it makes me sad the meditation from fourteen years ago helps me to see past all of this nonsense in our world remembering the ultimate truth that everything is energy and love the world doesn t have to be this crazy we can encourage one another to be ourselves and have creative expression we can acknowledge and support one another and i don t mean this in a cheesy way but in a real and practical way teachers and administrators can become better and more caring in their jobs parents can learn to become much much better parents judging and criticizing others no longer has to be the default setting and as beautiful as that may sound it s not the reality for many people on our planet i d like to acknowledge the reality while also point out that it doesn t have to be as chaotic as we make it everything is a choice and people often don t realize that they are unconsciously choosing conflict over peace conflict is not necessarily a bad thing as we re all entitled to our opinions and healthy disagreement is good but the challenge with our world is that it s constant never ending conflict here s the key encourage others and be the example inspire others and care about them keep their best interests at heart when and where possible within reason be kind instead of being discouraged by the dysfunction in our world use it to light a fire in you through leading by example and genuinely helping others you in turn light their fire a chain reaction goes off and the world becomes a better place one person at a time here s the blog post i wrote about this feel free to email me directly at jeff jeffdspeaks com,16 years ago when i was 17 years old i came incredibly close to dying by suicide i was severely abused and in addition to the abuse i was severely bullied in school i had no self esteem i also had all sorts of unexpected setbacks in sports and other areas of life i had no perspective no coping mechanisms and no friends i reached out for help no one cared and that s why after this year of clinical depression i picked up the rope in the dark night of my soul and very nearly ended my life but just before i died by suicide a spark of hope went off inside me from god i truly believe and know it was from god and the spark of hope told me to put down the rope and go back to my room no matter how dark your present circumstances are keep going i believe in you you have a purpose the world needs you,272,4,reliable,2,youtube,5.60947179518496,1.6094379124341005,1.0986122886681098,10,401,165,0.0147058823529411,0.0073529411764705

Ya0hnSEDYM7R,ca testimony against sb107 by 15yo double mastectomy recipient,sb107 is the proposal for gender affirming healthcare,my name is chloe cole i m 18 and my story is not hyperbole starting around the age of 12 i began to believe that i was transgender this belief was not organic all the media i consumed as a kid showed me how stupid and vulnerable being a girl was all the sexualized images of women gave me an unrealistic expectation of womanhood i spent a lot of time online and quickly saw all the praise coming out of trans god on instagram and other social media i was a bit awkward in school and had some trouble making friends like many dysphoric children i also suffered from a variety of mental health conditions so i easily fell prey to the narrative that if i felt different and did not want to be a highly sexualized girl i must be a boy i obsessed over becoming a boy i believed that all my insecurities and anxiety would magically disappear once i transitioned the mental health professionals did not try to dissuade me of this delusional belief i was fast tracked into medical transition after i was diagnosed with dysphoria in california a child can pick their gender identity and a care provider questioning that would be considered conversion therapy this wasn t a misdiagnosis it was mistreatment my parents were told that the options were transition or suicide they complied because they were not offered any other treatment solution for my distress my distraught parents wanted me alive so they listened to my doctors i was placed on puberty blockers and testosterone after expressing my gender dysphoria to my therapist and i was approved for a double mastectomy all by the age of 15 no one explored why i did not want to be a girl more and more kids are falling for the false promise of happiness if they transition gender clinics in the u s are turning a blind eye to european countries who are pumping the brakes on this experiment on youth who here really believes that as a 15 year old i should have had my healthy breasts removed or that it should have been an option when the cdph got less than 300 reports of people getting hospitalized as a result of vaping san francisco banned vape products that same year so i know that you care about the health of children yet you are allowing doctors all over the state to remove the healthy breasts of children how many more children s bodies will be destroyed before you actually listen what is the sweet spot 100 200 1 000 sb107 will open the floodgates for confused children like me to get the gender interventions that many so regret i am the canary in the coal mine,1101,73,reliable,36,bitchute,7.004881989712859,4.30406509320417,3.610917912644224,9,8,463,0.0663033605812897,0.0326975476839237

aNbq7WGoajZ4,autism adhd auto immune deficiency caused by aluminium nano particles in vaccines phc,phc public hearing attention deficit disorder autismauto immune,what are your thoughts on that well you heard earlier that there s no real concern about aluminum because it s such a small amount and so it really shouldn t matter but the kind of aluminum that we put into vaccines is a different kind of aluminum that we see environmentally this is called a nanoparticle nanoparticles bind really tightly to the bacteria antigens the virus antigens the food protein antigens and any other contaminants that are in the vaccines that we may not know about and we know that the biochemical properties of nanoparticles is that they are capable of entering the brain and so we have not evaluated the safety of the aluminum nanoparticle and its injection and where it goes when it gets into the body and whether it gets into the brain do the vaccine ingredients belong in the brain no do they get into the brain no one has ever studied it but animal studies using the same chemicals that are in vaccines that we give to children directly demonstrate that the vaccine ingredients do enter the brain we are ignoring this information there are scientists in europe who have actually done studies on the aluminum nanoparticle and have shown that it can persist in the brain for years and decades and so what we re seeing is a large outbreak of neurodevelopmental disabilities in adults including alzheimer s and one of the main factors that they re finding in the brains of people with alzheimer s is the aluminum nanoparticle that s directly related to the vaccines that we re giving so we have never studied whether the aluminum that we re giving in vaccines gets into the brain and we ve never measured whether it stays in the brain and what it does if it does stay in the brain but we do know that vaccines are supposed to cause inflammation in the body but we have more than half of our children with chronic inflamed conditions and we ve never allowed ourselves to ask the question if the vaccines cause inflammation acutely do they continue to create inflammation chronically we have one in five with neurodevelopmental disabilities one in 10 with add and adhd one in 35 with autism one in 11 with asthma and one in 20 under the age of five with seizures and the autoimmune diseases are exponentially rising and we are finding that the viruses and the bacteria that we re injecting into the body along with the adjuvants create something called molecular mimicry which means the body sees those viruses thinking that it s foreign but actually finds pieces of those viruses that match pieces of the self and the immune system doesn t differentiate between what it s been told to reject and itself so it will turn the immune system on itself leading to an autoimmune condition we know this about hepatitis b we know it about the gardasil vaccine and we know it about the flu vaccine and we continue to say unequivocally that the vaccines have been studied effectively and that they re safe and that s just not true psalm 58 do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge uprightly o ye sons of men yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely break their teeth o lord in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lions o lord let them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth bf watch tv 2021,626,14,misinformation,4,bitchute,6.440946540632921,2.70805020110221,1.6094379124341005,13,8,752,0.0223642172523961,0.0063897763578274

TqublZc4l6Y,fetterman reveals the accelerant for his depression,fox news contributor dr marc siegel joins fox amp friends to react to sen john fetterman and his recent admission that social media negatively impacted his depression #foxnews fox news channel fnc is a 24 hour all encompassing news service delivering breaking news as well as political and business news the number one network in cable fnc has been the most watched television news channel for 18 consecutive years according to a 2020 brand keys consumer loyalty engagement index report fox news is the top brand in the country for morning and evening news coverage a 2019 suffolk university poll named fox news as the most trusted source for television news or commentary while a 2019 brand keys emotion engagement analysis survey found that fox news was the most trusted cable news brand a 2017 gallup knight foundation survey also found that among americans who could name an objective news source fox news was the top cited outlet owned by fox corporation fnc is available in nearly 90 million homes and dominates the cable news landscape routinely notching the top ten programs in the genre,so he was treated for clinical depression shortly after winning his seat last year his senate seat and now senator john fetterman revealing what made his battle more difficult do you think that social media may have made your depression worse at the time oh yeah anybody it s in a it s an accelerant absolutely i would just warn anybody that social media i ve never noticed anyone to believe that their health their mental health has been supported by spending any kind of time on social media fox news medical contributor dr mark siegel joins us now to discuss doctor thanks for joining us happy new year you know i found this very interesting you say that things like depression but also anxiety poor self esteem eating disorders it loneliness in isolation all of those are accelerated by social media how s that so and add to that by the way joey sleep disruption and low self esteem and it s because of what said him senator fetterman is saying there and i agree with rachel here s something i actually agree with him on what it happens is that social media supposed to bring you in in terms of inclusivity but it ends up excluding you by targeting you by finding ways to ridicule you people are anonymous on social media joey so they don t have to be responsible for what they say so they so they get it out on other people by by a lot of meanness and and senator fetterman was talking about how his family was targeted and he was embarrassed and it made his depression more stigmatized and it was a downhill spiral so the the actual treatment for this by the way and i i love what you guys have been saying on the couch all morning about family family is the answer to this because when you go to the dinner table or when you get together with your family you ve got to exclude the iphones the social media and actually have a face to face gathering i tried it last night at a new year s eve dinner i didn t use my phone once and it was so much more positive the results i i had as a result you know you sleep better you you feel better about yourself you have more courage your self esteem goes up the studies have shown direct connection between excess use of social social media in our teens and low self esteem depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts incredibly bad epidemic going on right now yeah you talk about teens especially you know senator fetterman i obviously i feel for him and i hope that he gets better in that way he s grown he s had a career in politics he understands the pressure teenage girls is the is the the group most acutely affected by this should we do more to educate early on to educate parents and kids as they get on to social media and you were saying that before i completely agree with that and education is the key right it s not governmental restriction we ve seen that backfire during the pandemic you start with restricting and mandating and and you know saying what you can do from the government point of view that won t work but i think interventions early from the family but it s also a setting a spotlight on our lack of mental health services in this country by the way half of americans according to a kaiser family foundation study don t have access to real mental health care at all and if you do have access you may be embarrassed to go there so our mental health system is broken social media is accelerating the problem we need education from the family for starters and by the way most importantly if you re on that iphone your kids gonna be on that yeah if you re getting angry social media they re gonna get angry that s right thank you dr segal words of wisdom and and it s clinical science at this point stay off that iphone a little bit all right thanks doctor absolutely and watch you on tv great to see you joey happy new year

pVJ05f7GYXAX,autism adhd auto immune deficiency caused by aluminium nano particles in vaccines phc,no description,what are your thoughts on that well you heard earlier that there s no real concern about aluminum because it s such a small amount and so it really shouldn t matter but the kind of aluminum that we put into vaccines is a different kind of aluminum that we see environmentally this is called a nanoparticle and nanoparticles bind really tightly to the bacteria antigens the viruses the food protein antigens and any other contaminants that are in the vaccines that we may not know about and we know that the biochemical properties of nanoparticles is that they are capable of entering the brain and so we have not evaluated the safety of the aluminum nanoparticle and its injection and where it goes when it gets into the body and whether it gets into the brain do vaccine ingredients belong in the brain no do they get into the brain no one has ever studied it but animal studies using the same chemicals that are in vaccines that we give to children directly demonstrate that the vaccine ingredients do enter the brain we are ignoring this information there are scientists in europe who have actually done studies on the aluminum nanoparticle and have shown that it can persist in the brain for years and decades and so what we re seeing is a large outbreak of neurodevelopmental disabilities in adults including alzheimer s and one of the main factors that they re finding in the brains of people with alzheimer s is the aluminum nanoparticle that s directly related to the vaccines that we re giving so we have never studied whether the aluminum that we re giving in vaccines gets into the brain and we ve never measured whether it stays in the brain and what it does if it does stay in the brain but we do know that vaccines are supposed to cause inflammation in the body but we have more than half of our children with chronic inflamed conditions and we ve never allowed ourselves to ask the question if the vaccines cause inflammation acutely do they continue to create inflammation chronically we have one in five with neurodevelopmental disabilities one in 10 with add and adhd one in 35 with autism one in 11 with asthma and one in 20 under the age of five with seizures and the autoimmune diseases are exponentially rising and we are finding that the viruses and the bacteria that we re injecting into the body along with the adjuvants create something called molecular mimicry which means the body sees those viruses thinking that it s foreign but actually finds pieces of those viruses that match pieces of the self and the immune system doesn t differentiate between what it s been told to reject and itself so it will turn the immune system on itself leading to an autoimmune condition we know this about hepatitis b we know it about the gardasil vaccine and we know it about the flu vaccine and we continue to say unequivocally that the vaccines have been studied effectively and that they re safe and that s just not true psalm 58 do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge uprightly o ye sons of men yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely break their teeth o lord in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lion let them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with the whirlwind both living and in his wrath the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth,265,3,misinformation,1,bitchute,5.583496308781699,1.3862943611198906,0.6931471805599453,13,2,755,0.0113207547169811,0.0037735849056603

35oXfjxoXD6f,fda continues to turn a blind eye that thimerosal mercury in vaccines is causing autism,no description,but they still have thimerosal in them yes they still also have multi dose vials that do contain thimerosal why don t they go to single dose vials i know that they are considering the feasibility of why don t you tell them to do that we consider these vaccines which also contain thimerosal as a preservative to be safe and effective however we do consider that it s important to have vaccines did you hear any of the testimony earlier from those people that were testifying those scientists and doctors yes i did did you see the study from canada there that showed the damage that s done when a very minute amount of mercury is put in proximity to brain cells i think it s hard to extrapolate that data to what actually happens in the clinical situation well you know every study that s been done doctor that you guys have put forth as showing that there s no correlation between thimerosal and autism doesn t say categorically that thimerosal doesn t cause autism they never say that can you tell me right now categorically without any doubt whatsoever that mercury in vaccines does not cause autism i think what i d have to say is what the institute of medicine concluded is that the body of evidence neither allows no i want you to give me a yes or no can you tell me can you say right now just flat out just say can you tell me without any doubt whatsoever that the mercury in vaccines does not cause neurological problems or autism we can neither accept nor reject a causal relationship so what you re saying is you cannot tell me that you cannot say categorically can you you don t know one way or the other so why are you keeping something in there if you don t know one way or the other when you know that there s an epidemic of autism if there s an epidemic of something why do you keep it in there when you re not sure because every study i ve seen flatly says you re not sure you can t say yay or nay i think you have to consider the benefit that vaccines confer and there s a definite benefit from influenza vaccine and having an adequate supply of vaccine is very important okay well let me follow up on that then single shot vials does that need thimerosal no they don t but there are a lot well then why don t we have single shot vials there are a lot of manufacturing issues associated with switching over you need much more filling capacity for the lines you need a lot more other kinds of things that need to be introduced so although it can be done and both evans and aventus pasteur have started to introduce that it is not something that at present they have the capacity to do in entirety let me ask you this do these pharmaceutical companies that produce these vaccines have had in the past the ability to produce and have they produced single shot vials yes they do because that s how evans and aventus pasteur is doing it right now well how about all of the pharmaceutical companies do all the pharmaceutical companies pretty much have the ability to produce single shot vials you know i couldn t speak to that categorically i don t know but i do know certainly in the case of aventus pasteur and evans that they do have the ability because they are doing that then why hasn t the fda to be on the safe side knowing that we re having one in over 250 and in some cases one in 150 children becoming autistic and there s a growing body of evidence that thimerosal and mercury is causing that why wouldn t you go down the cautious road instead of coming up with these additional studies that say well we re not sure we can t say yay or nay why not go to single shot vials because we believe that the multi dose vials continue to be safe and effective and that they speak to having enough supply of influenza vaccine which serves a very important public health let me just end up by saying this you know i m a student i studied at the cincinnati bible seminary and i don t like to quote scripture very often but there s none so blind as those that will not see you just sit there and you keep saying over and over and over again that you think that there s not a real danger for having this mercury in these vaccines there s been 1 500 plus articles written saying that there is a problem we ve got scientists from all over the world coming in here you saw a demonstration from a canadian tape showing the impact of a minute amount of mercury in brain cells and yet you continue to say well we don t think that a very small amount of mercury in it but you don t know because there s no study that you put out that i ve seen not one that says categorically that mercury in vaccines does not cause neurological problems you can t tell me that today you ve hedged all over that issue and you guys just continue to keep coming up here and making excuses and i don t understand why why not just get it out of

IY04BrP0k0Sr,france s schizophrenic energy strategy russian lng imports increased,you know that your policy is not very successful when the state energy company is in debt the nuclear energy industry is half dead and the country strongly depends on russian gas imports right macron,despite the european union s block wide sanctions on its own energy supply from russia france is still the top importer of liquefied natural gas from russia paris has done so much damage to the country s own energy sovereignty over the past few years that it s struggling to loosen its grip on its russian energy sources while the eu is considering tougher sanctions against russia france has increased its imports becoming the world s largest buyer of russian lng france s nuclear energy industry was already in pretty rough shape before the conflict broke out in ukraine president emmanuel macron campaigned earlier this year for re election on the promise of a french nuclear renaissance pushing nuclear power as a green energy source to the absolute horror of environmentalists all of this comes well after macron announced back in 2018 the closure of 14 nuclear reactors by 2035 and before that macron oversaw the sale of france s taxpayer funded nuclear power know how alstom s nuclear turbine technology to the american defence multinational general electric in 2015 when he was adjunct secretary general to then president fran ois hollande but then macron reversed course on that sell out too announcing its buy back by edf this past february france s energy strategy if there even is one is schizophrenic at best the result half of its neglected nuclear reactors weren t working due to corrosion problems as france hit its first heat wave of the summer last month and the sweltering locals turned to fans or air conditioning france s energy output has tanked to a 30 year low creating a need to import energy even though the country is usually a net exporter in the summertime edf s strategy endorsed by the government was to delay the reinvestment and transformation of the system the more edf delays the more skills keep getting lost technical problems accumulate and there is a snowball effect and if all that isn t bad enough edf is strapped for cash and in debt and no one s more aware of it than the french president who tried to fix it all with huge promises edf will build and operate the new nuclear reactors this national sovereign company which is our common asset will be able to count on the support of the state on the financial and regulatory front massive public funding of tens of billions of euros will be committed to finance this new program this will preserve edf s financial situation and develop the entire industry so it s not exactly the best time for france or europe to forego russian energy which could explain why paris well simply isn t instead it s openly vaunting the eu s self harming anti russian sanctions all while quietly continuing to benefit from the important energy lifeline that russia represents for the french economy after paris single handedly made a mess of this critical economic sector,268,17,reliable,8,bitchute,5.594711379601839,2.8903717578961645,2.19722457733622,9,35,495,0.0634328358208955,0.0298507462686567

deeCxvIasqGX,anger where is it coming from,anger where is it coming from important note don t beat yourself up for getting angry the last thing you should do is to feel guilty about it try to understand the reasons behind it learn the lesson and try to channel the emotion in a different way here are some possible reasons behind getting angry lacking skills when faced with certain challenges feeling uncomfortable helpless or overwhelmed being loaded with emotions our values expectations clashing with the reality we find ourselves in it is important to understand what causes our outbursts of anger to learn the lesson and to grow we may need to consider releasing the emotions in a more controlled way or to channel the anger towards something we value,hi good morning i hope you can hear the birds in the background beautiful morning beautiful day ahead i would like to talk about having from time to time those explosions of anger it might be a small thing and we would just become angry and we would shout we would just release the emotions and after that quite often we might not be very happy with our behaviour because in anger you might say things you don t want or you might do things you really didn t plan to why why are we behaving this way there might be different reasons i think one of the reasons is just like we don t have the skills to manage our emotions so we just face with the situation we feel helpless and this is our reaction our skills just like not matching the situation so we would shout or we would just behave angrily only because we don t have the skills to face that situation and the other thing might be that a particular topic is we feel very very very loaded about particular topic so there was like lots of accumulated frustration and anger we didn t release in the past and we might be triggered by a very very small thing and it will be like an opportunity to release those emotions and the final thing is you know we can also be angry because certain things certain situation or certain behaviour is going against our core values so there is a clash between our view of the world and the situation we are facing so we may behave angrily because it s totally against how we see it should be but i think in that case it s good to understand why where the anger is coming from and maybe channel it in a way that it becomes constructive because anger can be channeled in a way that actually it may help us because anger making us fearless it gives us courage and it gives us motivation to move forward so we could channel our anger towards something good so it doesn t have to be bad always so it seems like they are not good or bad emotions it s just a question of how we use them so these are my reflections for today sitting in the woods and just thinking and i wanted to share it with you have a great day bye bye,98,1,reliable,3,bitchute,4.59511985013459,0.6931471805599453,1.3862943611198906,6,123,412,0.010204081632653,0.0306122448979591
