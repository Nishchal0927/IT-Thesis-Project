MHeQImEeg8CQ,about vaccines and autism the fda continues to turn a blind eye on the increasing body of data th,about vaccines and autism the fda continues to turn a blind eye on the increasing body of data that proves that the thimerosal mercury in vaccines is causing autism,but they still have thimerosal in them yes they still also have multi dose vials that do contain thimerosal why don t they go to single dose vials i know that they are considering the feasibility of why don t you tell them to do that we consider these vaccines which also contain thimerosal as a preservative to be safe and effective however we do consider that it s important to have vaccines did you hear any of the testimony earlier from those people that were testifying those scientists and doctors yes i did did you see the study from canada there that showed the damage it s done when a very minute amount of mercury is put in proximity to brain cells i think it s hard to extrapolate that data to what actually happens in the clinical situation well you know every study that s been done doctor that you guys have put forth as showing that there s no correlation between thimerosal and autism doesn t say categorically that thimerosal doesn t cause autism they never say that can you tell me right now categorically without any doubt whatsoever that mercury in vaccines does not cause autism i think what i d have to say is what the institute of medicine concluded is that the body of evidence neither allows no i want you to give me a yes or no can you tell me can you say right now just flat out just say can you tell me without any doubt whatsoever that the mercury in vaccines does not cause neurological problems or autism we can neither accept nor reject a causal relationship so what you re saying is you cannot tell me that you cannot say categorically can you we don t know one way or the other but so why are you keeping something in there if you don t know one way or the other when you know that there s an epidemic of autism if there s an epidemic of something why do you keep it in there when you re not sure because every study i ve seen flatly says you re not sure you say there s you can t say yay or nay i think you have to consider the benefit that vaccines confer and there s a definite benefit from influenza vaccine and having an adequate supply of vaccine is very important okay well let me follow up on that then single shot vials does that need thimerosal no they don t but there are a lot well then why don t we have single shot vials there are a lot of manufacturing issues associated with switching over you need much more filling capacity for the lines you need a lot more other kinds of things that need to be introduced so although it can be done and both evans and aventis pasteur have started to introduce that it is not something that at present they have the capacity to do in entirety let me ask you this do these pharmaceutical companies that produce these vaccines have had in the past the ability to produce and have they produced single shot vials yes they do because that s how evans and aventis pasteur is doing it right now how about all of the pharmaceutical companies do all the pharmaceutical companies pretty much have the ability to produce single shot vials i couldn t speak to that categorically i don t know but i do know certainly in the case of aventis pasteur and evans that they do have the ability because they are doing that then why hasn t the fda to be on the safe side knowing that we re having one in over 250 and in some cases one in 150 children becoming autistic and there s a growing body of evidence that thimerosal and mercury is causing that why wouldn t you go down the cautious road instead of coming up with these additional studies that say well we re not sure we can t say yea or nay why not go to single shot vials because we believe that the multi dose vials continue to be safe and effective and that they speak to having enough supply of influenza vaccine which serves a very important public health effort let me just end up by saying this you know i m a student i studied at the cincinnati bible seminary and i don t like to quote scripture very often but there s none so blind as those that will not see you just sit there and you keep saying over and over and over again that you think that there s not a real danger for having this mercury in these vaccines there s been 1 500 plus articles written saying that there is a problem we ve got scientists from all over the world coming in here you saw a demonstration from a canadian tape showing the impact of a minute amount of mercury in brain cells and yet you continue to say well we don t think that a very small amount of mercury but you don t know because there s no study that you put out that i ve seen not one that says categorically that mercury in vaccines does not cause neurological problems you can t tell me that today you ve hedged all over that issue and you guys just continue to keep coming up here and making excuses and i don t understand why why not just get it out of

bmddFg4SoN4,men s mental health#shorts #mentalhealth #viral theranveershowhindi,men s mental health refers to the psychological well being and emotional state of men it encompasses the various factors that influence a man s mental health including their thoughts feelings behaviors and overall psychological resilience while mental health affects people of all genders men often face unique challenges and societal pressures that can impact their mental well being historically men have been socialized to suppress their emotions and maintain a stoic facade which can make it difficult for them to seek help or openly discuss their mental health struggles this societal expectation of masculinity can lead to feelings of isolation and shame when faced with emotional difficulties consequently many men may downplay or ignore their mental health issues which can exacerbate their condition over time several factors contribute to men s mental health challenges these include traditional gender roles societal expectations often dictate that men should be strong self reliant and unemotional this can create a barrier for men to express vulnerability seek emotional support or ask for help when needed these pressures can result in internalized stress anxiety and depression stigma mental health stigma remains a significant hurdle for men seeking therapy or openly discussing emotions is sometimes perceived as a sign of weakness or incompetence this stigma can prevent men from seeking professional help exacerbating their mental health issues and hindering their recovery suicide rates men face higher rates of suicide compared to women the reluctance to seek help and the tendency to internalize emotional distress can contribute to this alarming statistic society s expectation that men should handle their problems independently can make it challenging to identify warning signs or intervene in time substance abuse men may turn to substance abuse including alcohol and drugs as a coping mechanism for their mental health struggles this can further complicate their mental well being and lead to a cycle of addiction and deteriorating mental health addressing men s mental health requires a multi faceted approach that focuses on breaking down gender stereotypes and promoting open dialogue about emotions and well being encouraging men to seek help and providing accessible mental health resources tailored to their needs is crucial by fostering an environment that encourages emotional expression offering mental health education and dismantling the stigma associated with seeking support society can positively impact men s mental health outcomes it is essential for men to recognize that seeking help is a sign of strength not weakness through professional therapy support networks self care practices and a willingness to address their mental health concerns men can take proactive steps towards improved well being and a healthier mindset ultimately promoting men s mental health is about fostering an inclusive and supportive society that acknowledges and respects the emotional experiences of all individuals regardless of gender by working together we can create a world where men feel empowered to prioritize their mental health seek assistance without judgment and lead fulfilling lives theranveershowhindi #motivation #viral #shorts #mentalhealth #life,at age 30,10,3,reliable,1,youtube,2.3978952727983707,1.3862943611198906,0.6931471805599453,7,494,3,0.3,0.1

BVfmrZRQ-vo,is weighing food tracking calories in association with my eating disorder #shorts,no description,food and track my calories and protein the short answer is no however i did for years i personally feel tracking your calories and protein is a great way to make sure that you re in a caloric deficit if your goal is to lose weight while still being able to incorporate and eat the foods that you love i think it s really important not to eliminate any foods and to be able to have great balance to preserve your mental health and longevity when it comes to losing weight sometimes tracking calories and protein can feel a little bit overwhelming especially at the beginning but it s really really important to remember that intuitive eating is the end goal another reason that i love tracking calories and protein as a weight loss approach is because it actually teaches you what is in the food that you re consuming which is a huge tool that you can utilize for the rest of your life without actually tracking for example i am really great at eyeballing food i typically understand what portion is associated with what calories i m also great at recognizing hidden calories and it s a tool that has aided me not only in a healthy way but also in a healthy way i ve also been able to track my calories and protein lifestyle but also in eating disorder recovery,15950,822,reliable,16,youtube,9.677276802172448,6.71295620067707,2.833213344056216,12,2,234,0.0515360501567398,0.0010031347962382

0RcbdUFS8bjM,l methyl folate active form folic acid for anxiety,just a thought under stress it s natural to go into fight or flight yet the law charges those who act according to nature with resisting arrest however the body of the arrestee is pumping out adrenaline which triggers fight or flight hence resisting is a natural process in accordance with evolution to over come fight or flight requires training how many civilians are trained how to properly over come fight or flight i guess not many crazy but true,you know we all know people that are suffering from anxiety if it if we haven t suffered from anxiety ourselves chances are we know somebody who suffered from anxiety and if you really break down what anxiety is right a fear of the future you know we have to understand that it doesn t require the presence of a fear for us to feel fear right so you could drive home tonight and pull into your driveway when you get out of your car somebody s standing in front of you with a knife right so that s a real fear right your pupils are gonna dilate your heart rates gonna increase your extremities are gonna flood with blood you re gonna start to have a fight or flight response mainly because an area of your brain has dumped catecholamines fight or flight neurotransmitters into your brain boom now you start to have a fight or flight response but you could also be laying on the 30th floor of a condo in bed and you could just start thinking about getting eaten by a shark yeah okay and the chances of a shark and now the ocean and coming up a 30 floor elevator right are zero but you can have the exact same reaction so how is it that i can have the same reaction to the presence of a real fear as an entirely perceived fear because it doesn t require the presence of a fear for these excess catecholamines to leak into the brain huh and this is the why the majority of anxiety that we have seen in our practices that my clinical team treats is coming from our physiology it s not coming from our outside environment in fact if you ask most people that suffer from anxiety three questions if you say have you had it on and off your entire lifetime they ll say yes there s your first sign that s a genetic deficiency and then you say well can you point to the specific trigger that causes it they ll say most of the time i can there s your second sign that it s not coming from their outside environment and then the third question is if you ve ever tried anti anxiety medications have they work the majority of time they ll say no it just makes me feel like a zombie that is very indicative that this is a nutrient deficiency and not a mental condition we have a lack of yeah so do you encourage people to take methylfolate as a supplement absolutely i encourage them i think everybody knows that they should take um what s its weight dependent but you know methylfolate about 800 micrograms a day is usually to fit is usually sufficient unless you take with food um you can take it with or without food it s a it s a non water it s a water soluble vitamin so unlike vitamins a d and k which are actually fat soluble that you need to take with food for them to be absorbed you can actually take those even on an empty stomach as long as you re not taking it with a bunch of other vitamins that cause you to be nauseous because it changes your stomach ph i think every single person should be at a minimum on a methylated multivitamin mm hmm the basic raw materials that your body needs to perform the process of methylation because methylation is how we create neurotransmitters right i mean we make serotonin from taking tryptophan and amino acid and methylating it into serotonin we make we make dopamine from you know phenylalanine and tyrosine if if you can t make these conversions you have certain deficiencies and yes you can have deficiencies in neurotransmitters which will lead to the expression of a mood disorder you don t have a mental illness you just have a lack of mental fitness and this is this is why it s that s crazy we re so quick to say that we have pathology and disease or dysfunction and then we go to chemicals and synthetics and pharmaceuticals and i m not anti pharmaceutical but i m saying is before we diagnose somebody with a mental illness or an autoimmune disorder or with an allergy or a sensitivity or irritable bowel syndrome or any number of other conditions we should ask ourself what raw material could be missing from their body that could be causing this to happen right i mean like when i was in,110,0,misinformation,1,bitchute,4.709530201312334,0.0,0.6931471805599453,9,80,771,0.0,0.009090909090909
